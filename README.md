 The Erkrav Equation â€“ A Bridge Between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity

Motivation Behind the Theory

The **Erkrav Equation** originated from a fundamental inquiry:

> Can we unify the principles of **quantum mechanics** and **special relativity** into a single coherent mathematical formulation?

Classical quantum mechanics (e.g., the SchrÃ¶dinger equation) provides accurate predictions for low-energy systems but neglects relativistic effects. Meanwhile, relativistic quantum equations like **Klein-Gordon** and **Dirac** have their own limitations and complexity.

This project began with a key observation:  
By **dividing the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation by Planckâ€™s constant** and comparing the structure with **Einsteinâ€™s relativistic energy equation**, a hidden structural connection emerges.

This led to the proposal of a new hybrid formulation:

\[
i \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi = \left( \sqrt{ -c^2 \nabla^2 + \left( \frac{mc^2}{\hbar} \right)^2 } \right) \psi
\]

Or in energy form:

\[
E \psi = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} \cdot \psi
\]

This equation aims to:
- Respect the **probabilistic and wave nature** of quantum systems,
- While **embedding the relativistic energy structure** directly into the evolution operator.
 Goals of This Project
- Formally define and simplify the Erkrav Equation.
- Compare it analytically and numerically to SchrÃ¶dinger, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations.
- Test limiting cases: low velocity (non-relativistic), zero mass (photon-like), high energy regimes.
- Present examples and simulations.
- Prepare for possible scientific publicationğŸ“„ License & Collaboration
This work is in early development. Feedback, collaboration, or formal review from theoretical physicists and mathematicians is welcome.
